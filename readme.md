# ACKNOWLEDGMENT
First of all, we wish to express our gratitude to the Almighty for giving us the strength to perform our responsibilities and complete the report. The junior project program is essential to bridge the gap between the theoretical knowledge and real life experience as part of Bachelor of Science (BSc) program. This report has been designed to have a practical experience through the theoretical understanding. We also acknowledge our profound sense of gratitude to all the teachers who have been instrumental for providing us the technical knowledge and moral support to complete the project with full understanding. It is imperative to show our appreciation for our honorable faculty member Shamim Al Mamun for his cooperation and relentless help to achieve this milestone. Also, our gratefulness is divine to the North South University, ECE department for providing us a course such as CSE 482 in which we could really work on this project and materialize it the way we have dreamt of. This course helped us to sort out all our mistakes and enhanced our acknowledgment. We thank our family, faculty members and entourage for their moral support to carve out this project and always offer their support. Without our lab instructor Farjana Alam, we would not implement such wonderful project as he helped us to make it better in every possible way.
